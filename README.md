# Data Structure & Algorithms
This is repository for revising Data Structure &amp; Algorithms 


### What is Data Structure?
A data structure is a method of organizing data in a computer system.

#### Linear Data Structure
 - Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 
 
_Examples of linear data structures are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc._

#### Static data structure
 - Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. 
   _An example of this data structure is an array._

#### Dynamic data structure
 -  In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory     (space) complexity of the code. 
    _Examples of this data structure are queue, stack, etc._

#### Non-linear data structure
 -  Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only. 
 _Examples of non-linear data structures are trees and graphs._
